# ThriftyBot2022
## Team 8604

ThriftyBot is a simple robot design made by Team 7407, which we based our design heavily upon. This isn't a place for discussion about the design, but the changes were a complete redesign of the intake and climber, and tweaks to the ball tunnel and shooter.
The drivetrain code was based off of our practice kitbot drivetrain project, because it is built on the KOP chassis.
Due to issues fabricating parts for our originial design, Team 8604 used ThriftyBot for the competitions during the main season.
